<h1>Repo Radar — MVP Report</h1>
<h2>LLM overview</h2>
<p>Window: last 30 days — repo: REPO-RADAR/repo-radar.<br><br>Notable trends/risks<br>- Key health indicators are missing (issues opened/closed, backlog Δ, high CVEs, Sentry error rate), limiting leadership visibility and risk assessment.<br>- Codebase highly concentrated in Python (97.4%) — simplifies staffing but increases dependency/CVE blast radius if not actively managed.<br>- Unknown backlog and error telemetry create delivery and production-risk blind spots that could hide regressions or security issues.<br><br>Recommended actions<br>- Immediately populate missing metrics (issues open/closed, backlog Δ, CVE severity list, Sentry error rate) and share within 48–72 hours.<br>- Run a dependency/CVE scan and prioritize remediation or mitigations for any high-severity findings.<br>- Stand up a weekly dashboard and assign an owner for metric upkeep and triage to restore continuous visibility.</p>
