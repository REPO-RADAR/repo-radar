<h1>Repo Radar — MVP Report</h1>
<h2>LLM overview</h2>
<p>Notable trends / risks<br>- Visibility gap: key metrics (issues opened/closed, backlog delta, CVEs, Sentry error rate) are TBD — leadership lacks actionable telemetry for last 30 days.<br>- Single-language codebase (Python-only) concentrates technical and dependency risk; unresolved CVEs would disproportionately impact the service.<br>- Potential operational risk: unknown error rate and backlog state could mask regressions or delivery bottlenecks.<br><br>Recommended actions<br>- Instrument and report: populate issues, backlog Δ, CVE status, and Sentry/error metrics on a recurring cadence (weekly).<br>- Run immediate dependency and security scans (SCA) and remediate any high CVEs; track fix ETA.<br>- Triage backlog and set SLAs for critical/bug fixes; add alerting for error-rate regressions to prevent production impact.</p>
